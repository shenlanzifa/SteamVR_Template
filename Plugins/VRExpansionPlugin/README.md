***NOTICE - Branched off of original motion controller plugin***

### Use Of This Plugin ###

This Plugin is intended to add additional functionality to Open/SteamVR in UE4. 

### How do I install it? ###

* Clone Or Download Zip and extract this repository to a folder named "VRExpansionPlugin" in your "ProjectName/Plugins" directory, create this directory if it is missing.

* Add the VRExpansionPlugin to your projects PublicDependencyModuleNames in the projects build.cs if you have c++ code included.

I will push pre-compiled binaries for all builds as well but I highly suggest that you have an installed compiler as it will re-build the project files for other engine versions for you then.
